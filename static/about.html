			<p class="about-desc">A little about myself how I started, and where I'm at now</p>
			<p class="about-desc">
				I still remember the day I first decided to fully commit myself to software engineering. It was February 7,2017 it was the day I sold all my bitcoin liquidated all of my 401k and IRA assets and put all my capital into being the best software engineer I could be.
			</p>
			<p class="about-desc">
				I used the money to invest in a myriad of learning resources from books, online courses and mentorship from developers at Spotify and Google. These learning resources, especially the mentorship, cut years off the learning curve for me. Being able to see the professional software development lifecycle from the best and brightest was pivotal. I still draw on these engineering principles and best practices till this very day
			</p>
			<p class="about-desc">
				To date I've worked on various things for companies as a contractor. Everything from working with designers to make user friendly designs, to working on interal API's for a company to making sure that a companies infastrctures can scale to meet the millions of users/month they've grown to. I'm very comfortable in any part of the web development stack, and have been told I'm a very well rounded full stack developer
