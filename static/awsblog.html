			<h4 class="be-hlght"> An Introduction </h4>
			<p class="be-p"> Amazon Web Services has been around 2006, and back then it only had one service remote computing to businesses (EC2).It has grown tremendously since then now having more than 90 services, and since then it's no the market leader in cloud providers. It's used by a broad spectrum of companies fortune 500 companies like netflix to budding startups. There's a reason why everyone wants to host and solve their application solution with AWS </p>

				How AWS will help your career and personal growth
			</h4>
			<p class="be-p">
				<ul>
					<li>It will make your more desirable on the job market </li>
					<li>Your salary will increase by adding more value to your business. The average certificate holder makes 100k +</li>
					<img src="./img/awsCertStats.png" class="be-img" style="max-height: 300px; margin: 2.5em 25% 2em 25%;">
					<li>You will be able to make more complex, interactive, and customizable apps</li>
					<li>You'll be needed at every point of the software development cycle. If your just a front-end or back-end developer the work to be done can ebb and flow. By adding more skills you'll become more valuable at every point </li>
					<p> This is loved in both big and small companies but especially startups</p>
					<li></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				I didn't get these bullet points off a list. This is what I've experienced in my personal life. The amount of contacts I got for job prospects increase 300% as well as the salaries they were offering.

				Also there is this component for <a href="adrianculinary.com">AdrianCulinary.com</a> that I'm working on that cannot be satisfied with a preexisting API. However with AWS I've begun to design my own API, and aggregating the data. All without having to incorporate a third patry tool.
			</p>
			<p class="be-p">
				However I've explained some of the benefits of learning AWS. It's only fair I tell you some of the cons
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> It's much different from code</li>
				<p>- Learning how to code is like learning how to play the flute or piano. Learning AWS is like learning how to be the orchestrator</p>
				<li></li>
				<li> The free online training material online is sparse, and the documentation is hard to grasp for people new to cloud</li>
				<p></p>
				<li>More Responsibility</li>
				<p>- If your a front-end developer and something in the UI looks wonky in one of the browsers it looks bad on the company, but the website can still be used. You can even make some mistakes in backend code that don't effect the business critical processes. However if your the primary Devops person. When the website goes down, or the database shuts down from being overloaded everyone is looking at you</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>What's the best way to learn AWS ?</h4>
			<p> It can be hard starting off with AWS or cloud services in general. AWS offers free tier to help you experiment with things with free while your learning. acloudguru is a good resource for those starting out, and cloudacademy when you get more experienced. Cloudacademy is also good because they have labs where they setup an enviornment in AWS and allow you to learn certain key features</p>
			<p> Then once you get comfortable the aws documentation will not seem so alien. This is one of the richest resources once you can grasp it. Amazon goes into minute detail on some of their services. For example they have over 1000 pages on elastic beanstalk</p>
			<p> </p>
			<h4> Important Things to Note</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I mostly see this appealing to backend developers, but front-end devs can still leverage this technology by using S3 and cloudfront to store static assets</li>
				<li>Getting AWS certifications alone won't get you a job. It's an ingredient in the soup</li>
				<li>The average salary for AWS certificate holders doesn't tell the whole story. When I went to AWS summit NYC 2017 I talked to a lot of people. The average person with an aws associate certificate had about 4 years experience, and the average professional had about 8 years. With a host of experience with multiple programming languages and paradigms. They also often knew how to use other software solutions alongside AWS</li>
