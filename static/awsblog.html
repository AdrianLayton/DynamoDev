			<p class="be-p"> An Introduction </p>
			<p class="be-p"> Amazon Web Services has been around 2006, and back then it only had one service remote computing to businesses (EC2).It has grown tremendously since then now having more than 90 services, and since then it's no the market leader in cloud providers. It's used by a broad spectrum of companies fortune 500 companies like netflix to budding startups. There's a reason why everyone wants to host and solve their application solution with AWS </p>
			<p class="be-p">
				<ul>
					<li> One big benefit of cloud is that you can scale you can scale your architecture up or down according to your businesss needs. This adjustability allows you to save money</li>
					<li> There are 16 worldwide regions. Making your application more durable by being resilant to single region failure. Not only making sure app stays up, but making sure your customers have low latency/quick response time  </li>
					<li> Technology made by Amazon that you can easily leverage </li>
					<li> Security: Did you know that the Equifax data leak happen because software patch wasn't updated? You can leverage AWS services , so that Amazon can handle all of the security aspect, and you can just focus on making your application</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="be-p"> By becoming knowledgable in AWS you will be able to offer these benefits to businesses, but you will also be richly rewarded in the following ways </p>
			<p class="be-p">
				<ul>
					<li>It will make your more desirable on the job market </li>
					<li>Your salary will increase by adding more value to your business. The average certificate holder makes 100k +</li>
					<li>You will be able to make more complex, interactive, and customizable apps</li>
					<li>You'll be needed at every point of the software development cycle. If your just a front end or back end developer the work to be done can ebb and flow. By adding more skills you'll become more valuable at every point </li>
					<p> This is loved in both big and small companies but especially startups</p>
					<li></li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				I didn't get these bullet points off a list. This is what I've experienced in my personal life. The amount of contacts I got for job prospects increase 300% as well as the salaries they were offering.

				Also there is this component for <a href="adrianculinary.com">AdrianCulinary.com</a> that I'm working on that cannot be satisfied with a preexisting API. However with the host of services on AWS. I feel confident that I can not only aggregate the data I need , but launch a API that will be highly available, scalable and secure courtesy of API Gateway
			</p>
			<p class="be-p">
				However I've explained some of the benefits of learning AWS. It's only fair I tell you some of the cons
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> It's much different from code</li>
				<p>- Learning how to code is like learning how to play the flute or piano. Learning AWS is like learning how to be the orchestrator</p>
				<li></li>
				<li> The free online training material online is sparse, and the documentation is hard to grasp for people new to cloud</li>
				<p></p>
				<li>More Responsibility</li>
				<p>- If your a front-end developer and something in the UI looks wonky in one of the browsers it looks bad on the company, but the website can still be used. You can even make some mistakes in backend code that don't effect the business critical processes</p>
			</ul>
